# WP Media Crawler - Explanation

## Package template changes

- I needed to adjust some settings of your package template. I mainly changed the composer.json, because some of the libs weren't being found. I did some general changes as well, so I would be able to feel a little bit more comfortable. The changes were the first thing I did and you can follow the main ones here in this commit: `TO BE ADDED`.
